// This file previously contained data for the patient-facing site.
// It can be repurposed for dashboard-specific data or removed if not needed.
// For now, it's empty.

// Example of how it could be used for sidebar navigation data if preferred over hardcoding:
/*
import {
  LayoutDashboard, CalendarDays, Users, UserPlus, List, Tag, Briefcase, Archive, PlusSquare, Settings, UsersCog, History, CircleDollarSign, ClipboardText, FilePlus, BarChart3
} from 'lucide-react';

export const sidebarNavItems = [
  // ... structure similar to the one in AppSidebar.tsx
];
*/

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module.
